# California House Price Prediction using Deep Neural Networks

## Overview:
This project focuses on predicting house prices in California using Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The goal is to develop a robust and accurate model that can predict housing prices based on various features, providing valuable insights for real estate stakeholders and potential buyers.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [/content/sample_data/california_housing_train.csv]. It includes a comprehensive set of features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors affecting house prices in California.

## Technology Stack:
Python
TensorFlow
Keras
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

## Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Explore and extract relevant features to improve the model's predictive performance.

Model Architecture: Design and implement a Deep Neural Network architecture using TensorFlow and Keras, considering the complexity of the problem.

Training: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset, optimizing hyperparameters for better performance.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Visualization: Visualize key insights and trends in the data, as well as the model's predictions.

Deployment: Optionally, deploy the trained model for real-time predictions or integrate it into a web application.
